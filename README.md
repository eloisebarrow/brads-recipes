## Project Description

In a 2-day sprint, two UX designers and two software developers came together to solve one problem: how can a working professional, Brad, who likes to cook but doesn't have time to shop, make more meals at home?

Our task was to design a solution and build one mobile-responsive screen of that design (without functionality).

We developed ReciPlease: here Brad can browse recipes which detail the number of ingredients, cooking time and serving amount, and order the ingredients to be delivered to him at a time of his choosing. The one screen we chose to build is the landing page which displays the header (including logo, cart, Brad's profile image and navigation links) and the body which has various search options and displays recipe images and corresponding details.
